We’re the development team behind [MkDrop](https://github.com/mkdrop-io), and we’re excited to introduce our project to the blockchain community. Our goal with MkDrop is pretty straightforward: make airdrops more efficient and effective. We want to ensure that these tokens really reach the people who are actively participating and contributing to the blockchain platforms, not just bots or opportunistic airdrop collectors.

#### Why MkDrop?

Through our own experiences and observations, we’ve noticed that while airdrops are a cool idea, they often don't work out as planned. We did several airdrops and dislike expirience of doing it. The tokens sometimes end up in the wrong hands, and many times, they don’t really do much to help grow or sustain the platforms they’re meant to support. That’s where MkDrop comes in. We're building a solution that can identify genuine users and reward them.
